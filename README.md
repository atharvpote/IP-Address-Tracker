## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - CSS in JS library
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) - Open source maps library
- [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) - React components for leaflet maps
- [Polished](https://styled-components.com/) - Toolset for writing styles in JS

### What I learned

This was a super fun project. I learned a lot about how to fetch API and how to fetch data. It was my first time using any map library, it was a bit confusing at first but I figured it our, overall it was a nice learning experience

### Continued development

I'm looking forward to use some other IP Geo Location API so app is not limited to 500 requests per month.
